# Install Docker Compose v2 on Linux x86 64-bit.
#
# Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker defined using the
# Compose file format. A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up
# your application are configured. Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your
# application with a single command: 'docker compose up'.
#
# Docker Compose V2 is a major version bump release of Docker Compose. It has been completely
# rewritten from scratch in Golang (V1 was in Python). The installation instructions for Compose V2
# differ from V1. V2 is not a standalone binary anymore, and installation scripts will have to be
# adjusted. Some commands are different.
#
# For a smooth transition from legacy docker-compose 1.xx, please consider installing
# i'compose-switch' to translate 'docker-compose' commands into Compose V2's docker compose. Also
# check V2's --compatibility flag.
#
# For more details, please visit:
#   https://github.com/docker/compose
#
# NOTE: Script should be run with 'root' privilege.
