# Lab Exercise 4
## Deploy the Server Agent & Network Agent to AKS

In this exercise you will need to do the following:

- Deploy the Server Monitoring Agent to AKS
- Monitor the Servers in the Controller
- Deploy the Network Agent to AKS
- Monitor the Network in the Controller

<br>

### **1.** Deploy the Server Monitoring Agent to AKS

Server monitoring Agents collect machine and infrastructure-level metrics like Disk I/O, throughput, 
CPU utilization, and memory usage. These metrics help operations teams get a pulse on their 
infrastructure, but they fall short when it comes to finding, isolating and troubleshooting problems 
that originate in the application code.  

Using the SSH terminal for the Launch Pad VM instance, change to the directory to deploy the Server 
Monitoring Agent by running the command below:

```bash
cd ~/AppD-Cloud-Kickstart/applications/aws/AD-Capital-Kube
```

<br>

To deploy the Server Monitoring Agent to AKS, run the command below:
```bash
kubectl create -f KubeMachineAgent/
```

You should see output from the command similar to the image seen below:

![Deploy SIM](./images/azure-aks-monitoring-lab-12.png)

Now wait two minutes and run the command below to validate that the agent has been deployed to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n default
```
You should then see output similar to the image seen below:

![AKS Pods](./images/azure-aks-monitoring-lab-13.png)

<br>

### **2.** Monitor the Servers in the Controller

Wait four minutes and go to your web browser and check the controller to see if the servers are 
reporting to the controller. You should see what the image below shows when you click on the Servers 
tab on the top menu:

![Controller Apps-1](./images/16.png)

<br>

Navigate into the AD-Capital application and click on the Servers tab on the left menu. You should 
see what the image shows below. The AppDynamics server agent has automatically associated the servers 
with the application:

![Controller Apps-2](./images/30.png)

<br>

Double click on one the servers in the view. You should see what the image shows below. Explore the 
different dashboards across the horizontal tab for the server (e.g. Processes, Volumes, Containers):

![Controller Apps-3](./images/31.png)

<br>

Drill into the Containers tab and double click on one of the containers to view the detail of the 
container as seen in the image below:

![Controller Apps-4](./images/32.png)

<br>

Navigate back into the AD-Capital application and click on the Containers tab on the left menu to see 
a summary of all the running containers for the application:

![Controller Apps-5](./images/33.png)

<br>

### **3.** Deploy the Network Agent to AKS

Using the SSH terminal for the Launch Pad VM instance, change to the directory to deploy the Network 
Monitoring Agent by running the command below:

```bash
cd ~/AppD-Cloud-Kickstart/applications/AD-Capital-Kube
```
Now run the following command below to deploy the Network Monitoring agent:

```bash
kubectl create -f KubernetesNetVisAgent/
```

You should see output from the command similar to the image seen below:

![Create NetViz](./images/azure-aks-monitoring-lab-14.png)

Now wait two minutes and run the command below to validate that the agent has been deployed to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n default
```
You should then see output similar to the image seen below:

![AKS Pods](./images/azure-aks-monitoring-lab-15.png)

<br>

### **4.** Monitor the Network in the Controller

Wait six minutes and go to your web browser and check the controller to see if the network agents are 
reporting to the controller. You should see what the image below shows when you click on the Network 
Dashboard tab within the AD-Capital Application Dashboard view:

![NetViz Dashboard-1](./images/19.png)

<br>

Now right click on the blue line connecting the 'Verification-Service' tier to the 'LOAN-MySQL DB-ADCAPITALDB-5.7.25' 
database and click on the 'View Network Metrics' option:

![NetViz Dashboard-2](./images/34.png)

<br>

You should see an image like the one below that shows the network metrics for the connection between the 
Verification-Service and the database:

![NetViz Dashboard-3](./images/35.png)

<br>

Back on the main Network Dashboard, click on the Explorer link under Connections near the top right 
of the screen to see a summary of all the connections like the image below:

![NetViz Dashboard-4](./images/36.png)
