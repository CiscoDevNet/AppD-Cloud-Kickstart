## Build your own Cluster Agent Docker image in AWS ECR

These instructions for building your own Cluster Agent Docker image in AWS ECR are for reference only and not intended to be part of the instructor led lab.  If you are participating in an instructor led lab, please use the pre-built Cluster Agent Docker image referenced [here](lab-exercise-06.md#2-build-the-cluster-agent-docker-image).

Use your [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and follow the steps below to create a Docker repository in AWS ECR within your region:

1. Click on the "Services" link at the top left of the console
2. Type in "ECR" into the search box
3. Click on the first entry named "ECR"

4. Click on "Repositories" on the left
5. Click on the "Create repository" button on the top right

<br><br>

6. Enter the name of your repository as seen in the image below and use your specific lab user number where the red arrow is pointing to, so you **ensure that your repository name is unique**.  For example, if your lab user name is "Lab-User-01" then your repository name would be "lab-user-01/cluster-agent"
7. Click on the "Create repository" button on the bottom right

<br><br>

10. Once you have pasted the command into the terminal window and executed the command, you should see a large block of text that you need to highlight and copy as seen in the image below where the block of text has been highlighted in grey

12. Use the command below to change to the docker directory in your SSH terminal window

```bash
cd ~/AppD-Cloud-Kickstart/applications/aws/AD-Capital-Kube/ClusterAgent/docker
```

<br><br>


16. Once you have copied the docker tag command into your SSH terminal window and executed it, you can then execute the ``` docker images ``` command and should see output like the image below.
